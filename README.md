**Random Sound Interval Project**

This is a small project I made by myself in a few hours, mostly because I wanted to be able to spook myself for no good reason while I was in the middle of doing Math coursework. 


**Features:**
- Select from 6 intervals of time

- Generates an array of random times between the chosen intervals

- Plays a randomly selected audio clip when the corresponding time has passed

- Generates a new random time after the sound clip has played

 

**Potential Bugs:**

- Potentially only functional on Windows PC's


**Notes: ** There's no limit to the length of audio clips you can use, so maybe don't go turning all of Shrek into an audio file just to play in this every 30 seconds over and over, okay?


If you for some reason have similar stupid ideas that should totally not be made into a small C# application please let me know. For some reason I enjoy making these bad ideas to torture myself with.
